          <h3>White Cane for Blind People</h3>
          <p>Guilly d'Herbemont (25 June 1888 ‚Äì 28 February 1980) was the inventor of the white cane for blind people. Guilly was the daughter of a Belgian and a Frenchman. She was born in Brussels as a child, she lived alternately in Brussels and Paris. She later moved to Paris as a musician and writer. It occurred to her that blind people on the streets of Paris were increasingly endangered by the motorization of transport. The police in France used white signal sticks to regulate traffic and stop cars. Ms d'Herbemont had the idea of putting the color white on sticks for visually impaired and blind transporters in order to draw attention to themselves.</p>

          <h3>Globe </h3>
          <p>This clever woman decided to develop a better globe. While teaching the changing seasons with the sun‚Äôs course and geography to her young charges, she thought she could do a much better job, which inspired her to design a special globe mounting. Fitz filed a patent in 1875 for this new globe mounting which showed the Earth‚Äôs daily rotation on its axis and the annual revolution around the sun, along with the effect of these rotations. </p>
